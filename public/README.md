# WINDOW SIZES
The window sizes that I based and tested the design on are: 
* Desktop: 1512 x 982 (Macbook Pro 14")
* Mobile: 390 x 844 (Chrome Dev Tools - iPhone 12 Pro)

# OUTLINE OF APPLICATION CONFIGURATION & DEPLOYMENT PROCEDURES 

* node.js 
* parcel
* 
* npm install
* npm run start - taking approx 2 mins at the moment 


# DEVELOPMENT PROCESS

# ITERATIONS & IMPROVEMENTS 

* Based on previous assessment feedback, I have changed to a multi step form on desktop as well as mobile. This will be both more visually appealing and more consitent for the user across web and mobile devices.  


* Changed layout of form slightly to adjust for the 1,2,3 page indicator for mutli step form - had to move close button 

* Added finish date input as it is unrealistic to assume that the input date is neccessarily the finish date
