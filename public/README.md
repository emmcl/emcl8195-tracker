# DEVELOPMENT PROCESS

# ITERATIONS & IMPROVEMENTS 

* Based on previous assessment feedback, I have changed to a multi step form on desktop as well as mobile. This will be both more visually appealing and more consitent for the user across web and mobile devices.  


* Changed layout of form slightly to adjust for the 1,2,3 page indicator for mutli step form - had to move close button 

* Added finish date input as it is unrealistic to assume that the input date is neccessarily the finish date
