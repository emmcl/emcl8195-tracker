# WINDOW SIZES
The window sizes that I based and tested the design on are: 
* Desktop: 1512 x 982 (Macbook Pro 14")
* Mobile: 390 x 844 (Chrome Dev Tools - iPhone 12 Pro)

2. Clone Repository 
Using the terminal

3. npm install
4. Start the server using either:

    * `npm run start` 
5. Open the application:
    * http://localhost:1234 (dev)

* Added finish date input as it is unrealistic to assume that the input date is neccessarily the finish date
